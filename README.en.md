# IOSDecryptHub

[中文](README.md) | **English**

Add the repo in Sileo / Zebra:

```
https://ios.decrypthub.com
```

Install the deb for your jailbreak (rootless or roothide). An **IOSDecryptHub** icon appears on the home screen: toggle target apps, check for updates and pick a version there. Force-quit a target app, then reopen it. Open `http://<device-ip>:8088` in a browser to use the live web panel:

No app is injected by default. Depends on ellekit.

## What's inside

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Injection loader | Reads the enabled list, `dlopen`s the engine only on a hit; contains no hooks |
| Engine dylib | The closed-source core; every hook lives in its constructor |
| Manager app | Home-screen icon: toggle apps, see engine version and update state, update / roll back |
| Updater daemon | One-shot process (launched on demand by launchd) that checks, downloads, installs and rolls back the engine |

## How updates work

Tap "Check for updates" in the manager app; it writes a request and launchd runs the daemon:

1. Resolve the latest version (reads the 302 of GitHub `releases/latest` first — no API quota; the API is only a fallback)
2. Download the engine, verify size and Mach-O architecture (arm64 family only); anything else is discarded
3. **Back up first** — a failed replace is restored from the backup, and no replace happens without a successful backup
4. After the atomic swap, running target apps are terminated, so the next launch uses the new engine
5. Rollback is a swap: it rolls back, keeps the version it just rolled off, and can roll again

No reinstall and no respring needed.

Build debs (macOS + Xcode + dpkg + ldid):

```bash
make deb
```

Simulated regression test for the update path (runs on macOS, no device needed, needs network):

```bash
make test-updater
```

## Capture layers and engine version

Network capture depth is decided by the **engine**, a closed-source artifact vendored at
`vendor/dylib/`. It evolves independently of `Makefile`'s `VERSION`, so the two can drift:
the package then claims the new version while still shipping the old engine, and nothing
fails. Packaging now refuses to proceed on a mismatch:

```bash
make verify-vendor     # package version vs vendored engine (no Xcode needed)
```

To bump the engine (fetch the release, update the dylibs and
`vendor/dylib/manifest.txt`, rewrite `VERSION`):

```bash
make sync-engine TAG=v1.28.0
```

Layer breakdown, plaintext-vs-ciphertext boundaries, known blind spots and the improvement
